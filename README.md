## Technologies used

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
(no frameworks or libraries)
## Approach

I started by writing the logic for the game in javascript and played it in the console to get an idea of what im going to be building. I then wrote the HTML and CSS to make the game playable in the browser. then in the js file i determined the input, output, formula and conditions (IOFC) needed to make the game work and after that i wrote the algorithm for the game. lastly i coded the games logic/functionality in javascript and refactored the code to make it more readable.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge i faced was the logic for the game. I had to think about the different scenarios that could occur and how to handle them. I also had to think about how to make the game playable in the browser. I had to think about how to make the game reset after 5 rounds and how to display the winner and the approach i took made this harder than it should have been, if i had created a separate function for the player selection it would have been easier to implement. I also had to think about how to make the game responsive and how to make it look good on different screen sizes.
